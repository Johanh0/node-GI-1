# Node GI 1 Challenge

This repository contains the solution to a challenge divided into three deliverables, each corresponding to a different application or functionality. The deliverables are as follows:

1. **Language Detection Code**
2. **Note Taking App**
3. **Hosted Weather App**

## Deliverable 1: Language Detection Code

**Description:**  
In this deliverable, a small application was created using an npm package to detect the language of a given text. The goal was to identify the language of the following phrases:

- "Es macht gut"
- "Dobrá práce"
- "Gwaith da"

The application uses a language detection library to accurately determine the language of each phrase.

## Deliverable 3: Hosted Weather App

**Description:**  
In this deliverable, a weather application was created using data from the WeatherStack API. The app allows users to check the current weather for a given location and choose the unit for temperature reporting (Celsius or Fahrenheit). The application is styled to be user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.

The app was deployed and hosted online, allowing users to interact with it in a live environment.
